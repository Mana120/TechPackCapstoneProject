## Data-Driven Packaging Optimization Project

This project at Techpack Solutions, focuses on data-driven packaging optimization in the packaging industry. By analyzing sales data and historical trends, we identified high-demand tile products and developed an interactive Looker Studio dashboard for demand forecasting and cost efficiency. Our work provides actionable insights to enhance packaging efficiency, align with customer demands, and improve overall performance. This GitHub repository serves as a resource for project documentation and code related to data-driven approach in the packaging industry.
